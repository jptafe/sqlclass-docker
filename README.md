# sqlclass-docker
A docker-compose script to stand up a set of relational databases and a frontend for students to conduct SELECT queries as a part of their learning

### Technology
This uses docker-compose with two microservices: 1) Mariadb 10.x and 2) PHPMyAdmin 5.x

### How to use this package in localhost
Install a Docker orchestration program like Docker Desktop (Windows & Mac)
```
git clone https://github.com/jptafe/sqlclass-docker
cd sqlclass-docker
docker-compose up
```
Then open your browser and open http://localhost:8080

### Technical info
This solution depends on the .sql file containing not only every database schema, but the read-only permissions to access the schema equivalent to the username/password configuations set in phpmyamdin section of docker-compose.yml.
